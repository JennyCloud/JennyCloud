# Hi, I’m Jenny Wang 👋  
Cloud learner focused on **Azure administration**, Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, and security.  
Building practical labs and real-world cloud engineering skills.

## 🚀 Focus Areas
- Azure Administration (AZ-104 path)  
- Infrastructure-as-Code with **Bicep**  
- GitHub Actions automation  
- Identity, governance, and cloud security basics  

## 💼 Background
My experience includes working as a **C#/.NET developer** and **system/cloud administrator** (non-Azure), supporting production systems, deployments, and troubleshooting. I also completed graduate studies in cybersecurity, which strengthened my understanding of system security and operational risk.

This foundation supports my transition into **Azure cloud engineering and DevOps**.
