# Hi, I’m Jenny Wang 👋  
Cloud learner focused on **Azure administration**, Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, and cloud security.

## 🚀 Focus Areas
- Azure Administration (AZ-104 path)  
- Infrastructure-as-Code with **Bicep**  
- GitHub Actions for automation  
- Identity, governance, and cloud security  

## 💼 Background
I previously worked as a **backend developer (C#/.NET) with SQL databases** and later expanded into **system/cloud administration** (non-Azure). This gave me hands-on experience with application troubleshooting, deployments, server management, and performance tuning. I also completed graduate studies in cybersecurity, which strengthened my understanding of system security and operational risk.

This foundation supports my transition into **Azure cloud engineering and DevOps**.

## 🧩 Projects
- **Azure Zero-to-Hero Portfolio:** Networking, identity, storage, VM, IaC, and troubleshooting labs  
- **Open-Source Contribution:** Documentation update to **Microsoft Azure/Bicep**

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
Azure · Bicep · PowerShell · GitHub Actions · Azure CLI · Windows Server · .NET/C# · SQL · Security Fundamentals
