# Hi, I’m Jenny Wang 👋  
Cloud learner focused on **Azure administration**, Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, and security.  
Building practical labs and real-world cloud engineering skills.

## 🚀 Focus Areas
- Azure Administration (AZ-104 path)  
- Infrastructure-as-Code with **Bicep**  
- GitHub Actions automation  
- Identity, governance, and cloud security basics  

## 💼 Background
My background includes working as a backend developer (C#/.NET) with SQL databases, and later taking on system/cloud administration responsibilities. This gave me hands-on experience with application troubleshooting, deployments, server management, and performance tuning. These foundations now support my transition into Azure cloud engineering and DevOps.

My experience includes working as a **backend developer (C#/.NET) with SQL databases** and later taking on **system/cloud administrator** (non-Azure) responsibilities. This gave me hands-on experience with application troubleshooting, deployments, server management, and performance tuning. I also completed graduate studies in cybersecurity, which strengthened my understanding of system security and operational risk.

This foundation supports my transition into **Azure cloud engineering and DevOps**.

## 🧩 Projects
- **Azure Zero-to-Hero Portfolio:** Networking, identity, storage, VM, IaC, and troubleshooting labs  
- **Open-Source Contribution:** Documentation update to **Microsoft Azure/Bicep**
